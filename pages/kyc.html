                    <hr>
                    <p>Hello Swati, it‚Äôs my pleasure, I am glad to interview you. Let‚Äôs get started‚Ä¶</p>
                    <p class="fst-italic text-white bg-secondary ps-1" style="--bs-bg-opacity: .5;">I have had the pleasure of collaborating and
                        coordinating with you during visits & meetings, and I found you to be a very inspiring leader.
                        Could you please describe your leadership style and how you ‚Äúlead‚Äù others?</p>
                    <p>I do not subscribe to a one-size-fits-all approach to leadership. Instead, I believe in being
                        flexible and adaptable according to the situation. Every individual and circumstance is unique
                        and requires a different leadership style. Therefore, I adjust my approach to meet the specific
                        needs of each situation and team member.</p>
                    <p class="fst-italic text-white bg-secondary ps-1" style="--bs-bg-opacity: .5;">Yeah, I must adapt your leadership style <span
                            class="fst-normal">üòä</span> What‚Äôs the biggest lesson you‚Äôve learned?</p>
                    <p>One of the biggest lessons I‚Äôve learned is the importance of embracing change and adaptability.
                        In the ever-evolving tech industry, being open to change and continuously adapting to new
                        technologies, methodologies, and challenges is crucial for sustained success.</p>
                    <p>Additionally, I‚Äôve learned the value of authenticity and resilience. Leading with authenticity
                        helps build trust and fosters a positive work environment, while resilience enables me to
                        navigate and overcome obstacles effectively.</p>
                    <p class="fst-italic text-white bg-secondary ps-1" style="--bs-bg-opacity: .5;">Given your emphasis on adaptability and resilience, did you ever have a woman leader as a mentor
                        or are there specific women who inspired you and how?</p>
                    <p>I am deeply inspired by Indra Nooyi. Her strategic vision, resilience, and authenticity as the
                        former CEO of PepsiCo have profoundly influenced my leadership style. Indra Nooyi's ability to
                        balance business success with social responsibility and her commitment to diversity and
                        inclusion resonate with my own values.</p>
                        <p>Her advocacy for women in leadership roles has motivated me to mentor and support other women in the IT field. In summary, Indra Nooyi's exemplary leadership inspires me to lead with integrity, innovation, and empathy.</p>

                    <p class="fst-italic text-white bg-secondary ps-1" style="--bs-bg-opacity: .5;">I know you always stay motivated and persevere through challenges. Let me move on‚Ä¶ you are undoubtedly busy; how do you take care of yourself and maintain a good mental health?</p>
                    <p>Even with a busy schedule, I make sure to take care of my mental health. I love meditating‚Äîit helps me stay calm and focused. Breathwork exercises are also a big part of my routine; they really help me manage stress. And of course, I can‚Äôt forget music! Listening to my favourite tunes is a great way to relax and recharge. These practices keep me balanced and ready to tackle whatever comes my way.</p>
                    <p class="fst-italic text-white bg-secondary ps-1" style="--bs-bg-opacity: .5;">Great! How do you encourage women to not give up?</p>
                    <p>Here are few points based on what I learned in my journey: Believe in yourself and your abilities. Set realistic goals and seek support from friends, family, and colleagues. Be adaptable and learn from setbacks. Prioritize self-care with meditation, breathwork, and music. Stay connected with a strong network of supportive women. Keep learning and growing. Celebrate your achievements, no matter how small. Stay resilient and keep pushing forward. Be true to yourself and lead with integrity.
                        </p>
                    <p class="fst-italic text-white bg-secondary ps-1" style="--bs-bg-opacity: .5;">You are right! We need to keep learning and growing. Why do you think companies would benefit from having more women at the top?</p>
                    <p>Companies benefit from having women leaders because they bring diverse perspectives and experiences, which can lead to more innovative solutions and better decision-making. Women leaders often excel in fostering collaboration and teamwork, creating a more cohesive and motivated workforce. Women leaders like Mary Barra: CEO of General Motors, and Indra Nooyi: Former CEO of PepsiCO are some such examples.</p>
                    <p class="bg-warning text-dark p-1" style="--bs-bg-opacity: .5;">Awesome! In a nutshell, your leadership style is characterized by flexibility, adaptability, authenticity, and resilience. You believe in tailoring an approach to meet the unique needs of individuals and situations, drawing inspiration from the visionary leadership of Indra Nooyi. üòä I am glad that I got a chance to talk to you and learn about you. üòä Thank you so much for speaking to us and inspiring us.</p>
